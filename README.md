# GSTA for travel time prediction

A deep learning approach to predict travel times.

This code is an implemnetaion of the paper titled "GSTA: Gated Spatial-Temporal Attention Approach for Travel Time Prediction".

We have provided a sample of 100K trips for each of the NYC and Chengdu Taxi datasets.

The sample data is already pre-processed and randomly splitted into train (X_train, Y_train), validation (X_val, Y_val), and test (X_test, Y_test).

We have implemented the prediction model for each dataset in a separate jupyter notebook (GSTA on NYC, and GSTA on Chengdu).

The dependent libraries are:

Keras 2.4.3

Tensorflow 2.3.0

Bokeh 2.2.1

Numpy 1.19.3

Pandas 1.1.5

Sklearn
